# Data Dictionary and Exact Dataset Schemas

Updated: April 30, 2026

This document is the schema-level source of truth for the project.
It covers:

- raw source datasets
- canonical transformed tables
- derived feature tables
- labels and targets
- which phase uses each dataset

The goal is to remove ambiguity. When a model says it uses "licenses" or
"review features," this document spells out the exact columns that means.

## 1. Shared Naming Rules

These identifiers appear throughout the pipeline:

- `nta_id`: NYC Neighborhood Tabulation Area code such as `BK09`, `MN22`, `QN70`
- `zone_id`: the recommendation unit after NTA-to-microzone aggregation
- `community_district`: coarse social-signal geography used for Reddit and 311
- `restaurant_id`: business or restaurant key used across operational tables
- `review_id`: review-level key used in labeling and NLP
- `time_key`: canonical derived time field, usually a year

Important distinction:

- `nta_id` is a source- or feature-engineering geography
- `zone_id` is the recommendation geography

## 2. Phase Map

| Phase | Main table(s) | Exact columns / contract | Status in repo |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Source audit | `DatasetAuditRow` | `name`, `owner`, `spatial_unit`, `time_grain`, `earliest_year`, `status`, `notes` | implemented |
| Raw ETL | source-specific tables below | fixed canonical schemas per source | mixed: some real ETL, some loaders, some stubs |
| Zone-year feature engineering | zone-year matrix | `zone_id`, `time_key`, joined feature columns listed below | implemented |
| NTA zone table enrichment | `data/processed/zone_features.parquet` | cuisine mix + optional Yelp NTA aggregates (see §5.12) | implemented |
| Neighborhood phase discovery | numeric slice of zone-year matrix | all numeric columns from phase matrix | implemented |
| Survival modeling | restaurant history table | exact columns listed below | implemented |
| NLP weak labeling | review-label cache | exact label columns listed below | implemented |
| Review aggregation | zone-time review features | exact aggregate columns listed below | implemented |
| Scoring / ranking | `feature_matrix.parquet` + `target` | all feature columns except dropped identifiers | implemented |

## 3. Raw Source Datasets

This section lists the canonical target schema for each source module.
If a loader currently reads a local file without coercing columns, the table
below still defines the schema that downstream code is supposed to standardize to.

### 3.1 `permits`

Purpose:

- proxy for renovation, construction, and physical change velocity
- intended for neighborhood phase discovery

Current code path:

- `src/data/etl_permits.py`

Canonical columns:

| Column | Type / meaning | Why it exists |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `permit_date` | currently stored as stringified year after aggregation | retained as the temporal source field |

| `permit_type` | permit subtype from DOB | separate major permit activity families |
| `job_count` | aggregated count of jobs in that `(nta_id, year, permit_type)` cell | velocity feature source |

Phase usage:

- planned for neighborhood phase discovery
- ETL implemented, but not yet wired into `build_zone_year_matrix()`

### 3.2 `licenses`

Purpose:

- official operating-business activity
- used for macro vitality signals and restaurant histories

Current code path:

- composite ground truth

Status:

- real ETL implemented and used downstream

### 3.4 `acs`

| `population` | area population | demand denominator / scale |
| `rent_burden` | housing-rent burden | pressure / affordability context |

Loader note:

- current `run_etl()` simply reads the local file pointed to by `ACS_DATA_PATH`
- the local file therefore must already be standardized to these columns

Phase usage:

- zone-year matrix
- phase discovery
- final scoring features

### 3.5 `pluto`

Purpose:

- built-environment and commercial-cost proxy

Current code path:

- `src/data/etl_pluto.py`

Exact transformed columns:

| Column | Type / meaning | Why it exists |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |

Status:

- Deprecated - features removed from matrix by team consensus.

### 3.8 `yelp`

Purpose:

- review text and rating enrichment
- review-level NLP input

| `review_text` | raw review text | NLP weak labeling input |

Loader note:

- current `run_etl()` reads the local file pointed to by `YELP_DATA_PATH`
- the file therefore must be normalized to the canonical columns above before
  it can be treated as the project's standard Yelp table

Phase usage:

- review NLP
- demand features
- composite ground truth

| `mention_text` | truncated post title / text | inspection and QA |
| `subreddit` | source subreddit | provenance |

Phase usage:

- planned social-demand enrichment

Status:

- real fetch path exists, but downstream conversion to `social_buzz` in the
  zone-year matrix is still a placeholder

### 3.10 `complaints_311`

Purpose:

- official fallback when Reddit is sparse

Current code path:

- `src/data/etl_311.py`

Exact transformed columns:

| Column | Type / meaning | Why it exists |

### 5.1 License velocity features

Produced by:

- `build_license_velocity_features()`

Exact columns:

- `zone_id`
- `time_key`

Exact columns:

- `zone_id`
- `time_key`
- `healthy_review_share`
- `social_buzz`

Current note:

- `healthy_review_share` is implemented
- `social_buzz` exists in the schema, but the current Reddit-to-zone conversion
  path in `_prepare_social_signals()` still returns an empty placeholder frame

### 5.4 Zone-year feature matrix

Current implemented joined columns:

- `zone_id`
- `time_key`
- `license_velocity`
- `net_opens`

- `healthy_review_share`
- `social_buzz`
- `population`
- `median_income`
- `rent_burden`
- `inspection_grade_avg`
- `restaurant_count`
- `rent_pressure`
- `mean_assessed_value`

Important note:

- this is the current implemented column set from the builder
- additional planned source families such as permits, Citi Bike, and 311
  are not yet joined into this matrix

### 5.5 Restaurant history for survival

Produced by:

- `build_real_restaurant_history()`

Exact columns:

- `restaurant_id`
- `zone_id`
- `cuisine_type`
- `duration_days`
- `event_observed`
- `inspection_grade_numeric`
- `rent_pressure`
- `competition_score`
- `transit_access`

Why the table exists:

- converts event logs into a right-censored survival dataset

### 5.6 Gemini label cache

Stored at:

- `data/processed/gemini_labels.parquet`

Exact columns:

- `review_id`
- `sentiment`
- `concept_subtype`
- `confidence`
- `rationale`

### 5.7 Aggregated review labels

Produced by:

- `aggregate_review_labels()`

Core output columns:

- `time_key`
- `healthy_review_share`
- `subtype_gap`
- `dominant_subtype`

Optional output columns:

- `frac_positive`
- `frac_neutral`
- `frac_negative`
- `topic_0_share`, `topic_1_share`, ..., `topic_{k-1}_share`

### 5.8 Topic-distribution table

Produced by:

- `topic_distribution_per_zone()`

Exact output pattern:

- `zone_id`
- `topic_0_share`
- `topic_1_share`
- ...
- `topic_{k-1}_share`

### 5.9 Zone embedding-feature table

Produced by:

- `y_review_quality`
- `y_license_velocity`
- `y_inspection`
- `y_composite`
- `missingness_fraction`
- `label_quality`

Why it exists:

- gives the learned scorer and ranker a target that combines multiple
  merchant-relevant outcomes instead of a single brittle proxy

### 5.11 Learned-model training matrix

Expected by:

- `src/models/train_scoring.py`

Required contract:

- a parquet file named `data/processed/feature_matrix.parquet`
- must contain a `target` column

Columns used by training:

- all columns except `target`
- then drop `zone_id`
- then drop `time_key` or `year` when present

This means the exact learned-model schema is:

- one identifier column family
- one time column family
- one target column
- any number of numeric and encoded feature columns

The current intended feature families are:

- macro zone context
- survival covariates
- NLP demand features
- competition and access features
- cost-pressure features

### 5.12 NTA `zone_features` enrichment (cuisine + Yelp)

Stored at:

- `data/processed/zone_features.parquet`

Produced / updated by:

- `src/data/enrich_zone_features.py` (`main()` reads the parquet, merges new columns, writes back)

Inputs:

- `data/processed/inspections.parquet` — requires `nta_id` and `cuisine_type`
- `data/raw/yelp_reviews_with_zones.csv` — optional; uses columns `nta` (6-char NTA) and `rating`

Join key:

- Rows use **`zone_id` = 6-character 2020 NTA code** (same string family as `nta_id` in inspections). Rows with non-6-char geography keys are dropped for the cuisine block.

Columns added or refreshed by this script:

| Column | Type | Meaning |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `cuisine_diversity` | float in `[0, 1]` | Normalized Shannon entropy of the `cuisine_type` distribution within the NTA. `0` when filled for unknown / no data. |
| `dominant_cuisine` | string | Lowercased mode of `cuisine_type` for the NTA. `unknown` when missing. |
| `high_risk_cuisine_share` | float in `[0, 1]` | Share of inspection rows whose lowercased `cuisine_type` is in the script’s high-risk set: `chinese`, `mexican`, `american`, `latin american`, `caribbean`, `bakery products/desserts`, `spanish`. |

Same script also merges Yelp aggregates (documented here so the file contract stays in one place):

| Column | Type | Meaning |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `yelp_avg_rating` | float | Mean Yelp star rating per NTA. Missing values filled with the column median after merge. |
| `yelp_review_density` | float in `[0, 1]` | Review count per NTA divided by the maximum count in the batch; `0` when no reviews. |
